        <p>I studied biology at the level of single cells and colonies using a 
           variety of analytical and computational techniques. This work primarily focused 
           on metabolism and regulation of methanogenic microbes and <em>E. coli</em>. This
           included modeling at many temporal and spatial scales ranging from kinetic modeling,
           to steady-state metabolic modeling, to spatially resolved biofilm modeling.
           During thesis work I created and/or maintained a number 
           of scientific and simulation software packages (<a href="https://github.com/JosephRyanPeterson/3DdFBA_Tools">3DdFBA Tools</a>, <a href="http://www.scs.illinois.edu/schulten/lm/">Lattice Microbes</a>). 
		   This work has resulted in 10 publications, so far.
